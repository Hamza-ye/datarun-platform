# Flagged Positions — Living Register

> Deferred verification items and quiet-decision markers that must not be forgotten.
> This file is **append-only**. Items move to `RESOLVED` with a resolution log entry — never deleted.
>
> **When to consult**: before drafting any new IDR, before starting any new phase, during any close-out audit. Every agent working on this platform is expected to read this register as part of onboarding to a new phase.

## Why This File Exists

Platform work is executed by multiple AI agents across sessions. Agents do not automatically carry context between sessions. When an item is "deferred," the decision to defer it is the easy part — **remembering to pick it up later** is the hard part. The Phase 1/2 envelope-type-vocabulary drift (resolved by [ADR-002 Addendum](adrs/adr-002-addendum-type-vocabulary.md) on 2026-04-21) is a concrete example of what happens when deferrals slip through:

- A decision is made at time T.
- Code is written at time T+N that silently contradicts the decision.
- No mechanism flags the contradiction until a later audit finds it.
- Fixing it becomes a retrofit (Phase 3e) rather than a one-line correction.

This register is the counter-mechanism: every deferred verification item, every quiet position that future work might contradict, every architectural precedent that needs defending — all recorded here with an explicit **gate** that must pass before the item is considered closed.

## Format (for every entry)

```
## FP-NNN — Short name
Status: OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | RESOLVED | SUPERSEDED
Opened: YYYY-MM-DD by <source>
Blocks: <IDR / Phase / nothing>
Severity: A (blocks architecture) | B (blocks an IDR) | C (cleanup hygiene)

### Context
What was observed, and why it matters.

### Trigger
When this item should be picked up. Usually "before IDR-NNN" or "before Phase N".

### Gate
The specific, verifiable outcome that proves the item is resolved. If the gate is not met, the item stays OPEN. No soft closures.

### Resolution log
Dated entries as work progresses. When RESOLVED, the final entry cites the commit or artifact that closes it.

## FP-001 — `role_stale` projection-derived role verification

**Status**: OPEN
**Opened**: 2026-04-21 by Phase 3e review pass (audit finding A3)
**Blocks**: IDR-021 (Role-Action Enforcement)
**Severity**: A — touches ADR-3 S3 structural constraint

### Context

ADR-3 S3 is a **Structural** constraint: *"Authority context is a projection, not an envelope field."* The existing `role_stale` detection in `server/src/main/java/dev/datarun/server/integrity/ConflictDetector.java` (lines 226–234) compares an actor's current role against their role at the time of the event. **It is not verified** whether this comparison reconstructs the role-as-of-event from the assignment event timeline, or reads it from a cache, or uses some other source.

If the implementation quietly violates S3 (reads role from anything other than replayed assignment events), IDR-021 would inherit the drift and cascade it into role-action enforcement — the same failure mode as the Phase 1/2 envelope-type drift. There is no existing test that would fail if role were read from a cache rather than derived, so the correctness here is load-bearing but unproven.

### Trigger

Before IDR-021 drafting begins. One hour of focused code reading, plus one integration test.

### Gate

All three must be true:

1. Code read confirms `role_stale` detection reconstructs the actor's role-at-event-time by replaying `assignment_changed` events up to the event's causal position, using projection semantics — not reading from any cache, envelope field, or snapshot.
2. A new integration test exists that cannot pass under a cache-based implementation: push event A with role X → admin changes role to Y via `assignment_changed` → push event B (B's creation watermark predates the change) → assert `role_stale` fires on B only, and only under projection-based derivation.
3. If the code does not meet (1), it is fixed as part of closing this FP — not punted to IDR-021.

## FP-002 — `subject_lifecycle` table read-discipline audit

**Status**: OPEN
**Opened**: 2026-04-21 by Phase 3e review pass (audit finding B3)
**Blocks**: Phase 4 (not a specific IDR — pattern state machines will interact with identity lifecycle)
**Severity**: B — projection discipline

### Context

The V3 Flyway migration introduced a `subject_lifecycle` table, populated during merge/split operations. Per ADR-1 S2 and ADR-5 S4, **state is always a projection of events, never an independent source of truth**. The escape hatch B→C explicitly permits projection caches — but only if every read is defensive (the cache can be rebuilt from events) and there is no read path that treats the cache as authoritative.

It is currently unverified whether `subject_lifecycle` is used as a write-only cache or whether any read path treats it as the state of record. If a read path treats it as authoritative, that is a silent stored-state drift — the same failure class as Phase 1/2 type-vocabulary, different layer.

### Trigger

Before Phase 4 implementation begins. Phase 4 adds pattern state machines that interact with subject identity — any existing sloppiness around identity state discipline will be load-bearing by the time patterns land, and will be much harder to unwind then.

### Gate

All three must be true:

1. Every read of `subject_lifecycle` is classified as (a) defensive/cacheable or (b) authoritative. If any read is authoritative, it is rewritten to read from events + alias projection instead.
2. A rebuild procedure exists (even if only documented) that regenerates `subject_lifecycle` contents from the event store, and a test proves the rebuild produces identical rows.
3. V3 migration file carries a comment: *"Projection cache. Rebuildable from events. Never the state of record."*

## FP-003 — Envelope schema parity test (meta-drift protection)

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**Opened**: 2026-04-21 by Phase 3e review pass (audit finding B4)
**Blocks**: Phase 3e Commit 3 (folded into 3e.5)
**Severity**: C — cleanup hygiene, but directly prevents a repeat of the root-cause drift

### Context

Two envelope schema files exist as independently-maintained copies: `contracts/envelope.schema.json` and `server/src/main/resources/envelope.schema.json`. Nothing enforces that they agree. The Phase 1/2 type-vocabulary drift was present in both because they were edited together — but nothing structural prevents one from being updated without the other, and that is the exact kind of invisible failure this register exists to prevent.

### Trigger

Phase 3e Commit 3 (docs). Already folded into scope — tracked here so that if the test is deferred for any reason, the deferral is explicit, not silent.

### Gate

A JUnit test `EnvelopeSchemaParityTest` exists in the server test suite that reads both schema files and asserts byte-for-byte equality (normalized for trailing newline). Test fails if they diverge.

### Resolution log

- **2026-04-21**: Opened. Folded into Phase 3e.5 as an in-scope deliverable.

## Standing Register Rules

These rules govern how the register is used. They are not items — they are the discipline.

### Rule R-1: No silent deferral

If an agent, during any phase, observes a position that is "almost certainly right but not verified" or "correct today but could drift under future work," the agent MUST add an FP entry before closing the phase. Not adding an entry and trusting memory is the failure mode that produced Phase 1/2 drift. **Silent deferral is a forbidden pattern.**

### Rule R-2: Gates are verifiable, not aspirational

Every gate must be expressible as "X is true" where X can be checked by reading code, running a test, or grepping for a string. "We believe this is fine" is not a gate. "Test FooTest asserts Y" is a gate.

### Rule R-3: Status changes only with evidence

Moving an item from `OPEN` to `RESOLVED` requires the resolution log to cite a commit SHA, test name, or artifact path that makes the gate pass. The orchestrating agent (not a subagent) is responsible for the status transition.

### Rule R-4: Consult before writing an IDR or starting a phase

Before any of the following, the active agent MUST grep/read this register for items whose `Blocks:` field names the upcoming work:

- Drafting a new IDR
- Starting a new phase spec
- Beginning the first commit of a new phase
- Publishing a close-out audit

Items that block the upcoming work must be resolved (or explicitly re-deferred with justification recorded in the item's log) before proceeding.

### Rule R-5: `SUPERSEDED` status for orphaned items

If an architectural change (a new ADR, an addendum, a phase spec) makes an FP item obsolete, mark it `SUPERSEDED` with a pointer to the artifact that absorbed it. Do not delete. History matters for traceability.
